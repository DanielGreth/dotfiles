# This script is based around Francesco Minnocci's script of same name
# Script for changin brightness
# Examples:
#    br set 50      to set brightness to 50%
#    br             to set brightness to default (80%)
#    br inc 2       to increse brightness by 2%
#    br dec 2       to decrease brightness by 2%



# Francesco Minnocci 2020
# Dependencies: dmenu, dunst [optional]



# NOTE: use the command lines to automatically set the
# parameters with fd [or find,  but it'll be slower]
# However, it's much faster to use the specific
# brightness file and ratio, once you know them.

#TODO change this to linear percieved brightness instead of what it currently is

# Set variables
default=80
